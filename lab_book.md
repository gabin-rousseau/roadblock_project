### Project: Computer simulation of a roadblock model of translational control
### Author: Gabin A. M. ROUSSEAU

_The following lab book contains daily entries of the tasks carried out by Gabin (bullet points), followed by weekly plans for the following week (task lists, updated every Saturday)._

# Week 1 - 15/01 --> 19/01

## Day 1 - 15/01
- Practiced using the Github dev environment in order to modify and run jupyter notebooks if ever necessary.
- Discussed lab desk usage and lab book format (this one).
- Discussed Health and Safety measures as well as Ethical implications: none to report. Will have to return to this topic if I get the chance to shadow someone in the lab out of curiosity.
- Discussed literature review: Edward oriented my search of publications towards the modelling aspect, specifically the distinction between translational elongation modeling and initiation (which we are focused on and is very rarely published about). _A contrario_, more peripheral considerations such as cell-wall biogenesis shouldn't occupy more than one paragraph. 
- __*Discussed worflow of the project: take a parallel approach where I make progress on the literature review and understanding the biology we are attempting to model, then experiment with the current version of the model to add in elements*__.
